pgAdmin 4
=========

pgAdmin 4 is a rewrite of the popular pgAdmin3 management tool for the
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org) database. 

At present, it is an experimental/proof of concept project. Use at your own
risk, and don't blame us if it breaks anything!

Architecture
------------

pgAdmin 4 is being written as a web application in Python, using jQuery and 
Bootstrap for the client side processing and UI. On the server side, Flask is
being utilised.

Although developed using web technologies, we intend for pgAdmin 4 to be usable
either on a web server using a browser, or standalone on a workstation. The
runtime/ subdirectory contains a QT based runtime application intended to allow
this - it is essentially a browser and Python interpretor in one package which
will be capable of hosting the Python application and presenting it to the user
as a desktop application.

Building
--------

To build the runtime, the following packages must be installed:

- QT 4.6 or above (older versions may work, but haven't been tested).
- Python 2.6 or above.

Assuming both qmake and python-config are in the path:

$ cd $PGADMIN4_SRC/runtime
$ qmake
Project MESSAGE: Building for QT5+...
$ make
...

To build the runtime in debug mode, use the option below with qmake
$ qmake CONFIG+=debug

To build the runtime in release mode, use the option below with qmake
$ qmake CONFIG+=release

By default, the runtime application will be built in release mode.

On Linux, an executable called 'pgAdmin4' will be built, and on Mac OS X, an
app bundle called pgAdmin4.app will be created.

To build the runtime on a Windows system, export PYTHON_HOME and PYTHON_VERSION 
variables in the System environment. Specify the PYTHON_VERSION with the major 
and minor number. Do not specify micro level version.
For example, given a Python version of A.B.C; A - Major number, B - Minor number, 
C - Micro level (Bug fix releases).

If Python version is 2.7.2 than specify PYTHON_VERSION=27

 e.g. PYTHON_HOME=C:\Python27\
      PYTHON_VERSION=27

Support
-------

pgAdmin 4 is completely experiemental and unsupported!
