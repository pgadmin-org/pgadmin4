`Restore Dialog`:index:
***********************

The *Restore* dialog provides an easy way to use a Custom, tar, or Directory
format backup taken with the pgAdmin *Backup* dialog to recreate a database or
database object.  The *Backup* dialog invokes options of the pg_dump client
utility; the *Restore* dialog invokes options of the pg_restore client utility.

You can use the *Query Tool* to play back the script created during a plain-text
backup made with the *Backup* dialog.  For more information about backing up or
restoring, please refer to the documentation for
`pg_dump <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html>`_ or
`pg_restore <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html>`_.

Use the fields on the *General* tab to specify general information about the
restore process:

* Use the drop-down listbox in the *Format* field to select the format of your
  backup file.

   * Select *Custom or tar* to restore from a custom archive file to create a
     copy of the backed-up object.
   * Select *Plain* to restore a plain SQL backup. When selecting this option
     all the other options will not be applicable.
   * Select *Directory* to restore from a compressed directory-format archive.

* Enter the complete path to the backup file in the *Filename* field.
  Optionally, select the *Browse* icon (ellipsis) to the right to navigate
  into a directory and select the file that contains the archive.
* Use the *Number of Jobs* field to specify if pg_restore should use multiple
  (concurrent) jobs to process the restore.  Each job uses a separate connection
  to the server.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Rolename* to specify the role that will be
  used to authenticate with the server during the restore process.

Click the *Data Options* tab to continue. Use the fields in the *Data Options*
tab to provide options related to data or pgAdmin objects that correspond to *pg_restore*.

Click the *Query Options* tab to continue. Use these additional fields to specify
the type of statements that should be included in the restore:


   * Move the switch next to *Include CREATE DATABASE statement* towards right position
     to include a command that creates a new database before performing the restore.

   * Move the switch next to *Clean before restore* towards right position to
     drop each existing database object (and data) before restoring.

   * Move the switch next to *Include IF EXISTS clause* towards right
     position to add an IF EXISTS clause to drop databases and other objects.
     This option is not valid unless *Clean before restore* is also set.

   * Move the switch next to *Single transaction* towards right position to
     execute the restore as a single transaction (that is, wrap the emitted
     commands in *BEGIN/COMMIT*). This ensures that either all the commands
     complete successfully, or no changes are applied. This option implies
     *--exit-on-error*.

  miscellaneous restore options:

   * Move the switch next to *Verbose messages* towards left to instruct
     *pg_restore* to exclude verbose messages.

   * Move the switch next to *Use SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION* towards right position
     to include a statement that will use a SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION
     command to determine object ownership (instead of an ALTER OWNER command).

   * Move the switch next to *Exit on error* towards right position to instruct
     *pg_restore* to exit restore if there is an error in sending SQL commands.
     The default is to continue and to display a count of errors at the end of
     the restore.

   * Use the *Exclude schema* field to not dump schemas whose name matches
     pattern.
