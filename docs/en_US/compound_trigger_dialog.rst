`Compound Trigger Dialog`:index:
********************************

Use the *Compound Trigger* dialog to create a compound trigger or modify an
existing compound trigger. *Compound Trigger* is supported only for EPAS server
12 and above. A compound trigger executes a specified code when certain events
occur.

The *Compound Trigger* dialog organizes the development of a compound trigger
through the following dialog tabs: *General*, *Events*, and *Code*. The *SQL*
tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the *General* tab to identify the compound trigger:

* Use the *Name* field to add a descriptive name for the compound trigger. This
  must be distinct from the name of any other compound trigger for the same table.
  The name will be displayed in the *pgAdmin* tree control.
* Store notes about the compound trigger in the *Comment* field.

Click the *Events* tab to continue.

Use the fields in the *Events* tab to specify how and when the compound trigger fires:

* Select the type of event(s) that will invoke the compound trigger; to select
  an event type, move the switch next to the event to the *YES* position.
  The supported event types are *INSERT*, *UPDATE*, *DELETE* and *TRUNCATE*.
  Views cannot have TRUNCATE triggers.
* Use the *When* field to provide a boolean condition that will invoke the
  compound trigger.
* If defining a column-specific compound trigger, use the *Columns* field to
  specify the columns or columns that are the target of the compound trigger.

Click the *Code* tab to continue.

Use the *Code* field to specify the code for the five timing events
*BEFORE STATEMENT*, *AFTER STATEMENT*, *BEFORE EACH ROW*, *AFTER EACH ROW*,
*INSTEAD OF EACH ROW* that will be invoked when the compound trigger fires.
Basic template is provided with place holders.

Click the *SQL* tab to continue.

Your entries in the *Compound Trigger* dialog generate a SQL command (see an example
below). Use the *SQL* tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes
to the SQL command.
