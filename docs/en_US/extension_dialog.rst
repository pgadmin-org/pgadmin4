`Extension Dialog`:index:
*************************

Use the *Extension* dialog to install a new extension into the current database. An extension is a collection of SQL objects that add targeted functionality to your Postgres installation.  The *Extension* dialog adds the functionality of an extension to the current database only; you must register the extension in each database that use the extension.  Before you load an extension into a database, you should confirm that any pre-requisite files are installed.

The *Extension* dialog allows you to implement options of the CREATE EXTENSION command through the following dialog tabs: *General* and *Definition*. The *SQL* tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the *General* tab to identify an extension:

* Use the drop-down listbox in the *Name* field to select the extension. Each extension must have a unique name.
* Store notes about the extension in the *Comment* field.

Click the *Definition* tab to continue.

Use the *Definition* tab to select the *Schema* and *Version*:

* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Schema* to select the name of the schema in which to install the extension's objects.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Version* to select the version of the extension to install.

Click the *SQL* tab to continue.

Your entries in the *Extension* dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the *SQL* tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the *Extension* dialog:

The command creates the *chkpass* extension in the *public* schema.  It is version *1.0* of *chkpass*.
