`Extension Dialog`:index:
*************************

Use the *Extension* dialog to install a new extension into the current database.
An extension is a collection of SQL objects that add targeted functionality to
your Postgres installation.  The *Extension* dialog adds the functionality of
an extension to the current database only; you must register the extension in
each database that use the extension.  Before you load an extension into a
database, you should confirm that any pre-requisite files are installed.

The *Extension* dialog allows you to implement options of the CREATE EXTENSION
command through the following dialog tabs: *General* and *Definition*. The *SQL*
tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the *General* tab to identify an extension:

* Use the drop-down listbox in the *Name* field to select the extension. Each
  extension must have a unique name.
* Move the switch next to *Cascade?* towards right position to automatically
  install any extensions that this extension depends on that are not already
  installed.
* Store notes about the extension in the *Comment* field.

Click the *Definition* tab to continue.

Use the *Definition* tab to select the *Schema* and *Version*:

* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Schema* to select the name of the schema
  in which to install the extension's objects.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Version* to select the version of the
  extension to install.

Click the *SQL* tab to continue.

Your entries in the *Extension* dialog generate a SQL command (see an example
below). Use the *SQL* tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes
to the SQL command.

Example

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in
the *Extension* dialog:
