pgAdmin 4 supports all PostgreSQL features, from writing simple SQL queries to
developing complex databases. It is designed to query an active database (in
real-time), allowing you to stay current with modifications and implementations.

Features of pgAdmin 4 include:

* auto-detection and support for objects discovered at run-time
* a live SQL Query Tool with direct data editing
* support for administrative queries
* a syntax-highlighting SQL editor
* redesigned graphical interfaces
* powerful management dialogs and tools for common tasks
* responsive, context-sensitive behavior
* supportive error messages
* helpful hints
* online help and information about using pgAdmin dialogs and tools.

When pgAdmin opens, the interface features a menu bar and a window divided into
two panes: the *Object Explorer* tree control in the left pane, and a tabbed browser in
the right pane.
